* CPU/GPU decode performance 

This repository contains the files used to evaluate the CPU/GPU jpeg image decode performance.

** CPU Decode Example

To build the example:

#+begin_src bash
cd CPU-decode; make
#+end_src

Run the CPU decode with the x.jpg as input:
#+begin_src bash
cd CPU-decode
./cpu-decode <dir_with_jpg_rgb_images> <number_of_images_to_decode> 
#+end_src


** GPU Decode Example 

Set the *-gencode* argument on [[file:GPU-decode/CMakeLists.txt][CMakeLists]] before the build. 
You can check the gpu architectures/virtual device architectures supported by the compiler with the following command:

#+begin_src bash
nvcc --list-gpu-code --list-gpu-arch
#+end_src

To build it:

#+begin_src bash
cd GPU-decode; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make; cd ..
#+end_src
 
To run:

#+begin_src bash
cd GPU-decode
# To run this example the following condition must be TRUE:
# number_of_images % batch_size == 0 
./build/nvjpegDecoder <dir_with_jpg_rgb_images> <batch_size> <number_of_images_to_decode> 
#+end_src
